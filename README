Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the US National Nuclear Security Administrationâ€™s Office of Radiological Security (ORS) have funded, developed and released a 3-dimensional model of the Gula Regional Hospital, a hypothetical facility for studying the protection of high-activity radioactive sources against theft or sabotage.  The 3D model is intended for unlimited distribution and is not subject to export control.  The 3D model is provided separately from the 3D engine for licensing and export control issues.  The Gula 3D model is intended to be run under the Unity 3D engine and supported with the latest long term support version (2022.3.27f1) which can be obtained here:  https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive. The 3D model is available at https://github.com/LLNL/Gula. Requests for further information, collaboration or changes/enhancements can be sent via email to Greg White (white6@llnl.gov).

The facility includes 2 stories above ground and a basement.  The basement contains two high-activity radiation sources, a blood irradiator (assumed to be using a cesium-137 or cobalt-60 source), and a teletherapy device (assumed to be cobalt-60) for treating cancer patients.  These parts of the facility are hardened from a physical security perspective.  The high-activity radiation sources are protected in keeping with ORS and international consensus.  This includes systems for access control, physical protection, video monitoring, and radiation detection.  The combination of these systems ensures a robust detection and response against external and insider threats of theft or sabotage.  The facility also contains a security department with a central alarm station (CAS), medical emergency room, treatment facilities, office space, etc.
